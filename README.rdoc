= local_config

local_config is a micro plugin that encapsulates the pattern of loading either the official foo.yml 
config file or the developer's personal foo.local.yml file.

== Example

    LocalConfig.load_config('database')

This loads RAILS_ROOT/config/database.local.yml if present. Otherwise loads database.yml.
Will return only the section related to the current RAILS_ENV by default.

If you have a file that isn't split in the usual RAILS_ENV sections, simply call

    LocalConfig.load_environment_config('foo', :environment => false)

== Install

Whichever you prefer:

    script/plugin install http://github.com/webmat/local_config.git

or 

    config.gem "webmat-local_config", :lib => 'local_config', :source => "http://gems.github.com"
